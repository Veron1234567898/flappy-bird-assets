# flappy-bird-assets

Assets and a playable Flappy Bird demo.

## Run locally

1. Start a static server from the repo root:

   ```sh
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

2. Open the demo in your browser:

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.html
   ```

If the canvas shows "Assets not found.", confirm you are serving the repo root and that the `sprites/` and `audio/` folders are alongside `index.html`.
